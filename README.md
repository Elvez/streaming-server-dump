# Miscellaneous

> "Because UDP doesn’t support retransmissions, packet ordering, or error-checking, there’s potential for a network glitch to corrupt the data en route"
whereas,
> "TCP requires a three-way handshake when transporting data. The initiator (client) asks the accepter (server) to start a connection, the accepter responds, and the initiator acknowledges the response and maintains a session between either end"
